                        This document addresses ethical concerns raised regarding the proposed subscription plug-in for our international student community platform. Based on comprehensive user research and ethical analysis conducted in A2 Design Research, I recommend implementing a minimal, privacy-focused approach that aligns with our users' needs and CCI's mission of inclusivity and ethical design.

                                The proposed plug-in requests extensive personal information (income, sexuality, detailed demographics) that exceeds what is necessary for newsletter functionality. This violates the principle of data minimization and creates unnecessary privacy risks.

                            Our research with international students revealed that extensive data collection creates significant barriers to participation, particularly for users with limited English proficiency, digital literacy, or mobile-only access. Additionally, collecting sensitive personal information (such as income or sexuality) that isn't necessary for newsletter functionality violates fundamental privacy principles and could expose our community members to unnecessary risks.

                            This approach aligns with CCI's mission of inclusivity and ethical design while ensuring our platform remains accessible and trustworthy for international students. The simplified process will actually increase subscription rates by reducing barriers and building user confidence.

                            I would be happy to discuss these recommendations further and provide detailed implementation guidance. Our priority should be creating a platform that serves our community's needs while maintaining the highest ethical standards.

                        The proposed subscription plug-in, as originally specified, presents significant ethical concerns that could harm our international student community and undermine CCI's mission. By implementing a minimal, user-centered approach that prioritizes privacy and accessibility, we can create a subscription system that serves both organizational needs and user welfare.

                        This ethical analysis demonstrates our commitment to responsible design practices and ensures that our platform remains a trusted resource for international students in Brisbane. The recommended approach not only addresses ethical concerns but also improves user experience and engagement.
