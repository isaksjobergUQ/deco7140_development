                    <p>
                        This assessment represents a collaborative approach to design and development, where I maintained full creative control over the design process while leveraging AI tools for efficient implementation. The final work reflects my understanding of UX design principles, user research methodologies, and technical implementation skills.

                    <p>
                        I believe this approach demonstrates responsible use of AI tools in academic work, where the AI serves as a collaborative partner in implementation rather than a replacement for critical thinking, design skills, and creative problem-solving.
