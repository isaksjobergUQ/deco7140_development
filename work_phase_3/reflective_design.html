                    Design decisions that connect with identity, values, and

                    <p>
                        Reflective design goes beyond functionality and
                        usability to address the deeper meaning and identity
                        that users derive from their interactions with the
                        platform. For international students, this means
                        creating a space that reflects their values, supports
                        their sense of belonging, and helps them see themselves
                        represented in the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This level of design connects users not just to a
                        website, but to a sense of shared identity, cultural
                        understanding, and long-term community engagement that
                        aligns with CCI's mission of fostering social cohesion
                        and celebrating diverse communities.

                        My A2 research revealed critical insights about
                        international students' needs and challenges in
                        Brisbane. Through comprehensive client needs analysis, I
                        identified three core value groups:
                        <strong>Inclusivity & Accessibility</strong>,
                        <strong>Community Connection</strong>, and
                        <strong>Trust, Ethics & Non-Commercial</strong>. User

                        (mobile-only, low bandwidth), Hana (shy, low digital
                        literacy), and Ava (local Brisbane resident)‚Äîuncovered
                        specific pain points around data usage, navigation
                        complexity, and cultural sensitivity.

                    <p>
                        The ethics analysis highlighted significant concerns
                        about excessive data collection in newsletter
                        subscriptions, with all personas expressing discomfort
                        about mandatory sensitive fields. Accessibility
                        assessments revealed the critical importance of
                        mobile-first design, plain language, and inclusive
                        imagery. These findings directly informed the
                        development of design principles that prioritize user
                        agency, cultural respect, and transparent data
                        practices.

                        Based on this comprehensive research and user analysis,
                        I have identified key values that should guide all
                        design decisions for the international student platform:

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            I acknowledge the client's goal of implementing a
                            newsletter subscription plugin to increase user
                            engagement and community retention. This is a
                            valuable objective for building long-term
                            relationships with international students.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ethical Reasoning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Key ethical risks identified through ACS Code
                            analysis:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Privacy Violations:</strong> Excessive
                                data collection beyond what's necessary for
                                newsletter functionality
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Consent Issues:</strong> Complex consent
                                mechanisms that may confuse users with varying
                                digital literacy

                                <strong>Data Security:</strong> Increased breach
                                risks from collecting extensive personal
                                information
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>User Coercion:</strong> Pressure on
                                vulnerable international students to provide
                                sensitive data
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Dark Patterns:</strong> Potential for
                                manipulative design that undermines genuine user

                        <h3>Recommendation</h3>
                        <p>
                            I recommend implementing a minimal, privacy-focused
                            approach:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Collect only essential information (email
                                address and first name)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implement double opt-in confirmation for genuine
                                consent
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Provide granular frequency control
                                (weekly/fortnightly options)
                            </li>
                            <li>Include one-click unsubscribe functionality</li>
                            <li>
                                Ensure transparent data practices with no
                                third-party sharing
                            </li>
                            <li>Offer clear data deletion options</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Client Benefits</h3>
                        <p>
                            This approach builds trust and brand reputation
                            while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
                            Higher-quality subscribers who genuinely want to
                            engage will result in better open rates and
                            community participation. The simplified process
                            actually increases subscription rates by reducing
                            barriers and building user confidence.
